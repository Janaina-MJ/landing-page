# Landing Page Project

This is a project to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/us)'s Front End Web Developer nanodegree.

## Overview

This is a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
The landing page dynamically builds the navigation menu. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump. Also, to improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed turns highlighted automatically, to differentiated it from the other ones.
